Useful programs for calculating the Wiener index of sparse graphs. Instead the O(n^3) complexity from the usual Floyd-Warshall algorithm, this one is O((n-n1-n2)^3), where n1 and n2 are the number of vertices of degree 1 and 2, so for graphs with lots of degree2- vertices, this program runs way faster.


More usability (like importing custom graph data) will soon be added.
